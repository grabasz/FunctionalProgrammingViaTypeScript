This is a short book about  functional programming concepts explained using TypeScript language. The key goal of this book is to present main ideas behind functional programming in a very simple and approachable way, not necessary to learn TypeScript language itself. TypeScript code can be easily understood by the programmers from a varied different backgrounds. TypeScript is just a JavaScript so it has "C like" syntax but it adds optional static typing. It supports different styles of programming like object-orientation, functional, scripting, dynamic and static. Even if you are an experienced functional programmer who knows Haskell, ML, Lisp, .... this book can be still beneficial for you because you will learn how amazing the TypeScript language is.
